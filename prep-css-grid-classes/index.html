      <h3>Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>
      <p>Dr. Indiana Jones, a renowned archeologist and expert in the occult, is hired by the U.S. Government to find the ark of
    the covenant, which is believed to still hold the Ten Commandments. Unfortunately, Hitler's agents are also after the
    ark. Indy and his ex-flame Marion escape from various close scrapes in a quest that takes them from Nepal to Cairo.

      <h3>Temple of Doom</h3>
      <p>
        The second of the Lucas/Spielberg Indiana Jones epics is set a year or so before the events in Raiders of the Lost Ark.
        Indy needs to retrieve a precious gem and several kidnapped young boys on behalf of a remote East Indian village. This
        time he teams up with a night club singer and a 12-year old boy.

      <h3>The Last Crusade</h3>
      <p>An art collector appeals to Jones to embark on a search for the Holy Grail. He learns that another archaeologist has
      disappeared while searching for the precious goblet, and the missing man is his own father, Dr. Henry Jones. The
      artifact is much harder to find than they expected, and its powers are too much for those impure in heart.
